<h1>Idea</h1>
<p>My brother owns a company, and i want to make a useful website for tracking employee hours during events. User's approved by Custom Events, will be able to create event's and employees, and be able to track which employee was at each event. User's will have the ability to keep track of employees hours from event. The hours will be kept on a database for Custom Events to use for payroll.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h1>MVP</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Users can create/edit/delete an event</li>
    <li>Users can create/edit/delete employees</li>
    <li>Once an event is created, employee sheet for the event gets generated, and user can add employees to employee sheet</li>
    <li>Users can keep track of time for each employee on employee sheet</li>
    <li>Users can submit employee sheet after each event, and have hours be tracked on a timecard for each employee. </li>
    <li>Employees and events will be stored on a database, and accessed through the server and sequelize</li>

</ul>
